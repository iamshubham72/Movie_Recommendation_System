# Movie_Recommendation_System
This is movie recommendation machine learning project in python using streamlit to host web app and  cosine similarity &amp; count vectorizer for creating algorithm to search for similar movies.

I have used Jupyter notebook for writing scripts and pickle to export the model.
This system recommends top 5 similar movies based on cosine similarity with score mentioned, related to movie you have wrote.
